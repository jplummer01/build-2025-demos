## Breakout Session at Build 25	
-Keynote: Microsoft Build opening keynote
 Microsoft Build opening keynote (Foundry Local will be mentioned during the keynote)

-Breakout: AI on your terms: Build & Ship AI Apps Across Platforms with Windows + Foundry 
Bring AI Foundry to Local: Building cutting-edge on-device AI experiences (Breakout session)
Build intelligent on device AI with Azure AI Foundry. With seamless integration and top performance across CPU, GPU, and NPU, as well as the seamless integration of Azure AI Foundry Model catalog and inferencing APIs for great developer experience cross local and cloud. Experience improved performance, enhanced security, and cost-efficient operations that minimize errors while enabling real-time processing both locally and in the cloud.

-Breakout: Azure AI Foundry: The Agent Factory - Azure AI Foundry: The Agent Factory (Breakout session where Foundry Local will be mention)
Join Azure AI Foundry's flagship session. Learn how to supercharge your AI development with our integrated signals loop that connects model choice, knowledge retrieval, fine-tuning, orchestration and memory —anchored by observability and trust. Design, customize, and manage intelligent agents using open standards and protocols such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) to connect with tools and drive collaboration. Gain insights into advanced orchestration, tracing, and monitoring to streamline decision-making, boost efficiency, accelerate time to market, and lower costs.

-Build and ship cross platform apps on-device with AI Foundry and ONNX - Build and ship cross platform apps on-device with AI Foundry and ONNX (Demo session)
Join us for a live coding demo to show you how to develop an AI-enabled application on device, in less than 15 mins. In real time you see how to download and install the tools, choose the best model, and develop the application.

## What’s Foundry Local?
Foundry Local is designed to streamline local AI app development and model deployment. It integrates services, models/agents/tools, and runtime for efficient optimization and execution on PCs, with future support for Macs, Android, iOS, and IoT devices. 

## What do customers need from Foundry Local
